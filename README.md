# Insights-from-India-s-2011-Census
SQL PROJECT

My project analyzed India's 2011 Census data, focusing on district and state-wise literacy, population growth, sex ratio, and area in square kilometers. Leveraging MySQL, I extracted insights into demographic and socio-economic dynamics. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization, highlighting my ability to draw actionable insights from complex datasets for informed decision-making.
